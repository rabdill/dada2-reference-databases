# Silva SSU 138.1, version 1

These R-markdown documents create and check the Silva 138.1 prokaryotic SSU taxonomic training data formatted for DADA2 that is deposited in (https://zenodo.org/record/4587955).

A small fraction of taxa in the training files are incorrectly treated as having a higher rank than the actually do; 
see (https://github.com/benjjneb/dada2/issues/1293) and the "bad-taxa" R-markdown and html files in this folder for more information.
A list of affected taxa are in [bad-taxa.csv](./bad-taxa.csv).
